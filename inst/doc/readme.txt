Scripts for producing tables and figures in "Augmented Shrunken Centroid Regularized Discriminant Analysis"  by M.S. Islam and A.I. McLeod.	
These R scripts require a multicore or cluster computer.   Both scripts used the new "recommended" package parallel.
SyntheticParallel.R
SpriaParallel.R
Both scripts were successfully executed on a PC with 24GB RAM.  The Spira datasets is very large. If you can't run the original, you can probably run it using only the selected 762 genes.  See comments in script file.
Also here is our script for using the rda package for gene selection:  SpiraGeneSelection.R
